# iMaterialist Challenge 2017 

Participation to a research prediction competition hosted on Kaggle.
iMaterialist is a fine-grained attribute recognition challenge for product images. For an image, we must answer to a known task as `dress:length`, `dress:occasion` or `pants:pattern`.  
Moreover, labels as `above knee`, `outdoor` or `floral` could be the answer to several tasks.
However, a task cannot be answered if the product is not in the image.
